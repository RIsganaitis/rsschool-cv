- For a few upcoming years my main goal is to become a respectful developer. At this stage, I just want to learnlearn, have people around me who are much better at coding. I am just a beginer, started learning just a three months ago, but I have managed to learn css, html and some js basics. I do not have finished nice projects, I am learning fundamentals how things work. For axample event listeners, objects, functions, methods and so on.
- I dont need easy ways, so I have joined to a bit experienced group. It is better to be last among the strongs, than the first among the weaks. Better for becoming better.
- Whats more, I was working for almost 15years as a B2B sales manager, so I can understand people, what they want and their expectations.
Company I was working is international company, at this moment owned by second largest company in the worls at mine sector, so my working culture is international too.
